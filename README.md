#Ultra Hopeful Weather Application

##Mission Statement

Hey you! Felt like that there wasn't enough weather fetchers/applications out there on that World Wide Web? Do you feel like what the Weather Channel's missing is some little sprites bouncing around the screen telling you the current temperature? Well look no further! With the Ultra Hopeful Weather Application, you can now get updates on not three, not five, but SIX cities from the cast of Danganronpa 2. Temperatures are laid out in a five day forecast and in four different temperature scales. Be amazed, as Chiaki informs you that Philadelphia is mostly cloudy at 378Â°K for up to FIVE seconds. Take note of the wonderful fading text, and the TWO page view aps as one. You'll be absolutely convinced that it's realer than real life.

Don't delay! This amazing (as well as legally required) free application is only available for the next forever (or when WebAssembly/new technology finally takes over)!
